This is a simple script that I wrote for my daughter in order to help her with multiplication.  I know there are a number of repetitive areas which isn't very DRY.  If I get a wild hair, I'll tighten everything up.

I left everything as separate files for no legitimate reason other than 'cuz'.  If I get around to it, I'll tighten that up, too.
